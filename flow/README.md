### Coherent large-scale vortices :cyclone::ocean:
* Three characteristic Reynolds number in bluff-body(e.g. simplest geometry like cylinder) were investigated
  * 2D unsteady laminar (49<Re<194): Karman vortex rollers  <br>
  * 3D transition-in-wake stability: <br>
    - mode A (190<Re<230): finer loops evolve into *streamwise vortices (ribs)*, spanwise wavelength $\lambda_z\approx 3-4D$ <br>
    - mode B (230<Re<300): even finer streamwise vortical braids $\lambda_z\approx 1D$ <br>
