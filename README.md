<## Numerical investigation of particle clustering in wake flows 

*🚦This project investigates the inertial spherical particles and please check out [my thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2976848) for the detailed simulation and analysis; <dr>
*⚓ The DNS/LES accoustic solver ["MGLET"](https://km-turbulenz.de/products-services/) is used for running particle-fluid flow simulations; <dr>
*🕸️ Multi-Grid Level mesh generation
*💧Particles' movement is tracked by solving Maxey-Riley equations
