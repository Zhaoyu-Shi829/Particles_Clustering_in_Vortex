## Numerical investigation of particle clustering in wake flows 
* 🚦 This project investigates the inertial spherical particles and please check out [my thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2976848) for the detailed simulation and analysis;
* ⚓  The DNS/LES accoustic solver ["MGLET"](https://km-turbulenz.de/products-services/) is used for running particle-fluid flow simulations; 
* 🕸️ Multi-Grid Level mesh generation
* 💧 Particles' movement is tracked by solving Maxey-Riley equations
