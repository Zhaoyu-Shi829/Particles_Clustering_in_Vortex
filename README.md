## Numerical Studies of Particle Clustering in Wake Flows 
* üö¶ This project documents [`my doctoral thesis`](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2976848). The emphasis of my PhD project is to systmatically investigate particle concentration and dispersion in vortex-dominated flows by leveraging DNS and HPC. This work spans a range of flow regimes, from <ins>laminar</ins> to <ins>turbulent</ins>, and particle properties such as <ins>density</ins>, <ins>size</ins> and <ins>volume fraction</ins>. To explain the intriguing **`clustering patterns`** of particles, I provided an in-depth study of the interaction between the dispersed particle field and coherent votex structures.
* üí°The principal goal is, from a fundamental perspective, to provide a better understanding of particle-flow interaction in many particle-laden processes, such as liquid-fueled combustion efficiency, particle dynamics in drug delivery, powder particle distribution in 3D printing, particle suspension and deposition in processing bed/reactor, source and sink of particulate pollution and many more manufacturing processes.

* My doctoral work includes several very interesting findings, such as the effect of particle-wall collision model resulting in the bow-shock pattern quantified by Voronoƒ±Ãà diagram, particle dynamics influenced by local vortices, scale-dependency of clutering in the transitional and turbulence wake, and correlation-based criterion for concentration identification.
